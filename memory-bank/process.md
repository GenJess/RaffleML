# RaffleML Project - First Version Setup Process

This document outlines the step-by-step process to get the first working version of the RaffleML project up and running. Tasks will be checked off as they are completed.

## Process Steps

- [ ] **Phase 1: Project Setup and Version Control**
    - [x] Initialize Git Repository: Created a local Git repository to manage project versions and track changes.
    - [x] Create GitHub Repository: Set up a private GitHub repository to back up your code and enable branching for future development. Repository created at https://github.com/GenJess/RaffleML.
    - [ ] Docker Setup (Optional but Recommended):
        - [ ] Create a `Dockerfile` to containerize the Python script and its dependencies.
        - [ ] Build a Docker image for the RaffleML script.

- [ ] **Phase 2: Logging and Initial Script Execution**
    - [ ] Implement Basic Logging: Integrate a logging library in the Python script to record key events and outputs. Initially, logs can be stored in a local text file within the project directory.
    - [ ] Run Initial Script: Execute the `[active]-raffle-background-script.py` to ensure it runs without errors and produces the expected initial output.
    - [ ] Review Logs: Check the generated log file to confirm that the logging system is working and capturing relevant information.

- [ ] **Phase 3: Documentation and Memory Bank**
    - [ ] Create Memory Bank Files: If not already present, create `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, and `progress.md` in the `memory-bank/` directory to document the project's architecture, technologies, current status, and progress.
    - [ ] Document Initial Setup:  Record all setup steps, configurations, and initial observations in the Memory Bank, particularly in `activeContext.md` and `progress.md`.
    - [ ] Establish Documentation Workflow: Define a process for updating the Memory Bank with every change, ensuring that each modification is documented with a line explaining the reason.

- [ ] **Phase 4: Iterative Development and Refinement**
    - [ ] Small, Incremental Changes: Focus on making small, testable changes to the script, prioritizing stability and progress over large, potentially breaking modifications.
    - [ ] Continuous Documentation: After each change, immediately update the Memory Bank to reflect the modifications and their purpose.
    - [ ] Regular Testing and Review:  Run the script frequently and review logs to ensure that changes are working as expected and that the system remains stable.
