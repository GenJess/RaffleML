# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Cross-Platform Project Transfer

## 1. Overview
This PRD defines the requirements for a project transfer system that facilitates the seamless movement of projects between platforms. The transfer system is designed to ensure that both human users and AI agents can maintain context, continuity, and productivity. The document aims to outline key project data, provide historical context, and support ongoing progress by capturing lessons learned, messaging history, project goals, and dynamically updating next steps.

## 2. User Personas

### 2.1 Primary User Types
- **Human User (Project Owner)**: Individual managing the project who needs to move their project between platforms while retaining all necessary information, historical context, and next steps.
- **AI Agent (Project Collaborator)**: AI model assisting with tasks, generating recommendations, maintaining project continuity, and dynamically updating next steps.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Data Capture and Transfer
- **Requirement:** Capture all project data (overview, context, goals, message history, lessons learned, direction, next steps) and enable seamless transfer to the destination platform.
- **Automatic Syncing:** Ensure that AI agents maintain and update next steps dynamically in response to user input and project progress.

### 4.2 User Experience
- **Requirement:** Provide an intuitive user interface to review and customize project data before and after the transfer.
- **AI Support:** Allow the AI agent to review transferred data, provide recommendations, and flag missing or inconsistent information.

### 4.3 Integration and Compatibility
- **Requirement:** Ensure compatibility with various platforms (e.g., project management tools, AI-assisted platforms, and collaboration suites).
- **API Support:** Develop APIs to facilitate data extraction, transfer, and syncing between platforms.

### 4.4 Security and Privacy
- **Requirement:** Implement robust security protocols to protect user and project data during transfer.
- **Data Encryption:** Ensure data encryption during transfer and storage.
- **Access Control:** Provide fine-grained access control to limit who can view and modify transferred data.
